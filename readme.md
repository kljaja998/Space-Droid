<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the game 

In this web game, you play as a droid restricted in a region of space with only one goal. To destroy as many enemies as possible. The more you hesitate to kill enemies, the more they will appear on screen for you to have to kill. If you don't they'll make sure to attack you. Careful though, as you only have a restricted number of lives.
